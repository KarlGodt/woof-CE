Initrd.gz isn't actually a compressed filesystem anymore (definitely since 3.00, possibly since 2.17). It's now a compressed cpio archive. To extract it, do something like this:

mkdir initrd-tree; cd initrd-tree/; zcat ../initrd.gz | cpio -d -i

That assumes you're using a terminal in the same place as the initrd.gz file. It dumps the innards into a directory named initrd-tree/ in that location.

To put it back together, run these from inside that initrd-tree/ directory:

rm ../initrd.gz501; find . | cpio -o -H newc | gzip -9 > ../initrd.gz501
