Initrd.gz isn't actually a compressed filesystem anymore (definitely since 3.00, possibly since 2.17). It's now a compressed cpio archive. To extract it, do something like this:

[Updated 110922] Lighthouse 64 5.13+ uses xz to compress instead of gzip:

mkdir initrd-tree; cd initrd-tree/; xz -cd ../initrd.xz | cpio -d -i -m

That assumes you're using a terminal in the same place as the initrd.xz file.
It dumps the innards into a directory named initrd-tree/ in that location.

To put it back together, run these from inside that initrd-tree/ directory:

mv ../initrd.xz ../initrd.xz.`date +"%Y.%m.%d_%T"` # to save prior version
find . | cpio -o -H newc | xz --check=crc32 --x86 --lzma2 > ../initrd.xz
