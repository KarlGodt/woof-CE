      <br>
The previous release was version
4.2.1 (also known as 4.21 or 421) coordinated by "WhoDo". I (Barry
Kauler) am back coordinating this release, 4.3.<br>
      <br>
Oh man, where to start?! This release is a massive upgrade, right from
its very roots to topmost branches. The place to read about what has
happened is my blog, <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog">http://puppylinux.com/blog</a>,
and I have scanned back through it, picking out highlights for
inclusion in this announcement. There is no particular order below,
just inserted as I found some point of interest...<br>

      <h2>Redesigned from the roots</h2>
After I released Puppy 4.1.2, I "kind of" retired and WhoDo (Warren) took over
coordinating 4.2.0 and 4.2.1. WhoDo did a superb job, but he then decided
he had enough, so I have stepped back in to coordinate 4.3. There are
various reasons why I have taken on this role again, one of them that I
have developed a whole new system for building puppies, that I name <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Woof</span>. This replaces the Unleashed build system. I also designed a new package management system, called the <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Puppy Package Manager</span>, or just <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">PPM</span>,
needed to cope with Woof's ability to build a Puppy from the packages
from any distro (Debian, Ubuntu, Arch, Slackware, T2, etc.).<br>
      <br>
Yes, the Woof build system can build a Puppy from the binary packages
from any distro, but in the case of Puppy 4.3 Woof has been used to
build "Puppy from Puppy". That is, this is a continuation of the Puppy
4.x series, using the PET packages. To get your mind around this, I
highly recommend that you read my introductory web pages on Woof and
PPM:<br>

      <h2>Highlights of 4.3</h2>
These highlights are in no particular order, nor are they a complete
list of what has happened since Puppy 4.2.1. There is just too much.
Lots of guys have helped, and I haven't acknowledged everyone. But I
have provided lots of links.<br>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Latest kernel</span>. I
have built 4.3 with the 2.6.30.5 kernel, configured for SMP (multiprocessor) systems (but
also works fine on uniprocessor systems) This kernel supports the
ext4 filesystem and is patched for Aufs2. Thanks to tempestuous for help with upgrading the firmware. <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=01021">1</a> <br>
</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Internet by dialup</span>.
Unlike many other distros, Puppy has not forgotten those who access the
Internet by analog modem dialup. The kernel has drivers for many
modems, including Agere, ESS, Lucent, Conexant, Smartlink, Pctel and Intel
chipsets. Rerwin has done an incredible job here, and in most cases we
have automatic detection and configuration. Rerwin has also done a lot of work on dialup via 3G devices. <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00832">1</a> <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00831">2</a> <a href="http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=42722">3</a> <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00692">4</a> <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00721">5</a> <a href="http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=36455">6</a>  <a href="http://murga-linux.com/puppy/index.php?f=32">7</a> <br>
        </li>

        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pstreamvid</span>. This is a great GUI for playing streaming video, that is, Internet TV. Created by trio. <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00949">1</a> <a href="http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=45023">2</a> <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00923">3</a> <br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">CPU Scaling Ondemand</span>. A convenient little app created by trio, for those who find their CPU runs too hot. <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00974">1</a> <a href="http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=45143">2</a> <br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">JWM Theme Maker</span>. A convenient little app created by trio, to create a theme for the JWM window manager. <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00981">1</a> <a href="http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=45397">2</a> <br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Psync</span>. Created by tasmod, synchronises the clock to an Internet time server. <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00972">1</a> <a href="http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=42978">2</a> <br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mscw</span>. Kirk created this interesting little GUI to change sound cards. <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00957">1</a> <a href="http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=44972">2</a> <br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">pCD</span>. Zigbert has
created many applications for Puppy. Many of them, including Pburn,
Pfind and Pbackup, are upgraded. pCD is a new little app for playing
audio CDs. <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00951">1</a> <a href="http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=41883">2</a> <br>
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">QUISP</span>. Puppy has
not yet settled on any particular database development system. QUISP
was in Puppy 2.x series, and I have decided to bring it back. The
attraction is that it is extremely small yet very powerful. QUISP is a
CGI web-browser frontend that can be used for providing anything in a
web page, including but not limited to support for the SHSQL backend. I
have put a tutorial into 4.3, plus the 'devx' file has the full
documentation and further tutorials. Basically, QUISP is back for us to
play with and evaluate, to be considered as a possible permanent
resident. <a href="http://quisp.sourceforge.net/">1</a> <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00937">2</a> <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00936">3</a> <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00935">4</a> <br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">SQLiteManager</span>. This
is a frontend for SQLite and is an addon for SeaMonkey (but does run as
a standalone application). Like QUISP, I have put it in for evaluation.
Note that there is also SQLiteDBMS which is not included but is
available as a PET package. <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00846">1</a> <br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hiawatha</span>. This web server is being used in Puppy to serve CUPS, PPLOG and QUISP pages. Hiawatha is very small and extremely secure. <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00893">1</a> <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00894">2</a> <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00202">3</a> <br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Linux-dvb-apps</span>. I have put this package in by request from the guys who are into DVB. It provides needed infrastructure. <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00932">1</a> <br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Screenshot utility</span>.
Puppy has a screenshot utility based on mtPaint, but with a very basic
GUI. Trio has overhauled the GUI, added more features and made it look
nice. <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00916">1</a> <a href="http://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=44916">2</a> <br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pmirrorget, Pwsget</span>.
Forum member Gposil has created these great little GUI apps. Pmirrorget
is for downloading a complete website, Pwsget adds username/password to
our frontend for wget (originally created by Lobster). <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00915">1</a> <a href="http://www.gposil.com/pets.htm">2</a> <br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aqualung</span>.
This is a
very nice audio file and CD player. We do of course have other
applications that play audio files and CDs, including pCD, Gxine and
mhWaveEdit, plus commandline utilities, so there is a plethora of
choice
here! <a href="http://aqualung.factorial.hu/">1</a> <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00881">2</a> <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00879">3<br>
          </a></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Crop background for widescreen</span>.
I have modified the code that places a background image on the desktop
such that it will crop an image to prevent it being distorted on a
widescreen monitor. <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00869">1</a> <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00864">2</a> <br>
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">NicoEdit</span>. This is a
great little text editor written by Nicolas in Genie. This uses
Gtksourceview for syntax highlighting and also has highlighting for
Vala and Genie code. I have also retained the Geany text editor from
before, although NicoEdit is one tenth of the size -- please test
NicoEdit, report back -- I will probably promote NicoEdit to replace
Geany in the next release of Puppy! <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00853">1</a> <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00829">2</a> <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00810">3</a> <a href="http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=46629">4</a> <br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pictureviewer, EmbeddedBookmarks, PuppyBrowser</span>.
These are fantastic applications written by MU in Genie. PuppyBrowser is a complete web browser based on the
'gtkmozembed' library in SeaMonkey. Puppy uses PuppyBrowser as the
local HTML help-page viewer, and for viewing CUPS, PPLOG and QUISP
pages. <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00812">1</a> <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00809">2</a> <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00808">3</a> <a href="http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=39498">4</a> <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00727">5</a> <br>
</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Viewnior</span>. We have a new default image viewer. Viewnior is simple, small and also supports slideshows.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gtkhash</span>. A nice little GUI for generating hashes. Forum member ttuuxxx has packaged it up very nicely for Puppy, with Rox integration. <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=01053">1</a> <br>
        </li>

        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ext4 support</span>. Puppy
4.3 built with the 2.6.30.5 kernel has full support for ext4. I have
upgraded GParted, e2fsprogs, disktype, GRUB and guess_fstype. The
latter is a utility created by Jesse, one of our hardware interfacing
experts. <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00754">1</a> <br>
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Xdelta GUI</span>. I have
written a drag-and-drop frontend for the Xdelta utility. This is a file
difference manager, and is great for those on dialup when it comes time
to upgrade to a new version of Puppy -- just download a small
"difference file". <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00753">1</a> <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00752">2</a> <br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ayttm</span>. This is our
choice of multi-protocol chat client, because it is small yet capable.
One of the main developers, Siddhesh, is very active and responsive to
our requests. <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00926">1</a> <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00691">2</a> <br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gtkdialog text markup editor</span>. 
In
Puppy Linux we make heavy use of Gtkdialog for GUIs written in Bash/Ash
scripts. Gtkdialog is easy to use and fairly powerful. One problem
though is limited documentation.
If you have the 'devx' file loaded, you will find code examples
at&nbsp; /usr/share/doc/gtkdialog3, which are invaluable. However, Gtkdialog
has capabilities that are not documented or hardly so. Vovchik has provided this aid. <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00672">1</a> <a href="http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=40418">2</a> <br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bcrypt GUI</span>. Forum
member coolpup developed a GUI tool to encrypt files, using the
'bcrypt' commandline utility. Coolpup has also developed another with
heavier encryption named Pcrypt. <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00665">1</a> <br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">JWM window manager</span>.
For a long time Puppy has used JWM, except long long ago when we used
Fvwm. The developer Joe stopped work on the project, and two of our
guys, HairyWill and Patriot, fixed some bugs. Joe came back and incorporated these fixes into the
official source plus added some extra improvements. <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00614">1</a> <a href="http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=39162">2</a> <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00573">3</a> <br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">ms-sys</span>.
I have put this in, but not using it for anything yet. Steve_s was
discussing ms-sys awhile back on the forum, and it looks like it could
be useful when installing Puppy. <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00607">1</a> <a href="http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=37673">2</a> <br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">BootFlash</span>. This is
a GUI application I have written for installing Puppy to Flash drives.
It is an alternative to the Puppy Universal Installer and is an attempt
to offer all the different means of installing to flash in the one
tool. <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00599">1</a> <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00597">2</a> <br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Poweroff after mouse inactivity</span>. 
Thanks to forum member steel_i who thought of this. I have used the <span style="font-weight: bold;">getcurpos</span> utility to detect mouse position. <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00562">1</a> <a href="http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=36109">2</a> <a href="http://dzen.geekmode.org/dwiki/doku.php?id=misc:xget-mouse-position">3</a> <br>
</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">FullerScreen</span>. This
application is described as a "slide presenter", but it is really a
nice tool for creating presentions (like Powerpoint). It does need
basic HTML editing capability though. FullerScreen is an addon for
SeaMonkey, but runs standalone. <a href="http://xsidebar.mozdev.org/modifiedmisc.html#fullerscreen">1</a> <br>
        </li>

        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Addons for SeaMonkey</span>. I have already mentioned <span style="font-weight: bold;">SQLIteManager</span>  and <span style="font-weight: bold;">FullerScreen</span> above. In addition 4.3 has <span style="font-weight: bold;">Zombiekeys</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Adblock</span>. Note that if you open the Help page in Puppy there is a HOWTO that explains how to use zombiekeys. <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=00547">1</a> <a href="http://xsidebar.mozdev.org/modifiedmisc.html">2</a> <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/assistance/hfws.aspx?AssetID=HP051865621033">3</a> <br>
</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">SFS Converter</span>. The
2.6.30.5 kernel has Squashfs 4.0, which is not compatible with older
SFS files. Puppy will detect incompatible SFS files, and now offers a
converter, created by forum member trio. <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=01027">1</a> <a href="http://puppylinux.com/development/package-management.htm">2</a> <br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pcur</span>. I wrote a mouse cursor selector GUI. Especially useful if your eyesight is not so good and you want a bigger mouse pointer. <a href="http://puppylinux.com/blog/?viewDetailed=01011">1</a> <br>
        </li>

        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Network Wizard</span>. Dougal has continually refined our Network Wizard, and there is a very long forum thread detailing its development. <a href="http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=31522">1</a> <br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">And so much more</span>...
lots of improvements in the underlying scripts, bugfixes, application
upgrades, massive help from the guys with testing -- I won't even
attempt to list names.</li>

If you have a "pup_save" file and you want to upgrade it, it has to be
renamed. Say that you are booting from live-CD and you have
'pup_save-john.2fs' on the hard drive (or whatever) -- make a copy of
it (to be on the safe side!) named 'pupsave.2fs', then boot or reboot
Puppy 4.3. That's it, pup 4.3 only recognises save files of name
'pupsave*.2fs' (where '*' means wildcard).<br>

The official 4.3 has the latest kernel, 2.6.30.5, however some old PCs
work better with older kernels (though fortunately the large majority
are happy with the latest kernel!). Puppy-enthusiast-developers will be
building 4.3 with older kernels, such as 2.6.25.16 that is used in 4.2x

patched 2.6.30.5 source tarball or SFS file -- the latter enables you
to compile a module even running Puppy from live-CD or frugal install. <a href="http://puppylinux.com/sources/kernel-2.6.30.5/">1</a> <a href="http://distro.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/distributions/puppylinux/sfs_modules-4/">2</a> </li>

Thanks to the guys who helped with the default in 4.3 (especially
ttuuxxx for the icons and 01micko for tweaking the background). The
guys who are
into the graphics side of things have been very busy, so if you want
something different, there are heaps of themes available -- play
and play until you get something you like! I would like to thank Dejan,
who has put in the effort to collect GTK, JWM themes, desktop icon-sets
and background
images into the one place for the convenience of the rest of us. You
can also find lots of themes on the forum, created by a very
enthusiatic bunch of guys! <a href="http://puppy-look.tk/">1</a> <a href="http://puppylinux.com/technical/themes.htm">2</a> <br>
</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">SFS files</span>. I have
mentioned 'devx_430.sfs' and 'zp430305.sfs' files above. So, what
actually are these .sfs files? This is a truly wonderful feature of
Puppy. Newcomers, please read this page: <a href="http://puppylinux.com/development/package-management.htm">1</a> <br>

This is something that is fun! You can build your own custom live-CD.
There are two basic methods, either remaster the current live-CD (see
'Remaster Puppy live-CD' in the 'System' menu), or build from scratch
using Woof -- the latter requires some Linux commandline expertise and
a Linux hard drive partition. <a href="http://puppylinux.com/woof/">1</a> <br>

If you discover a bug in 4.3, or something doesn't work, please browse
around in the forum. There are feedback threads for dialup modems, 3G
modems, video, Network Wizard, and so on. If you can't solve your
problem, please report to this thread, which is specifically for 4.3
bug reporting. I will be monitoring this thread and hopefully Puppy
4.3.1 will have fixed your bug! <a href="http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=46594">1</a> <br>

      <h3>Writing programs</h3>
Puppy has a HOWTO page on programming builtin, so I won't write much
here. Open the main Help page and follow the link. Highlighting some
points though...<br>
      <br>
Most of our Puppy developers code in Bash/Ash and use Gtkdialog,
Xdialog and xmessage for GUIs. Our 'devx' SFS file provides a complete
C/C++ programming enviroment, and some coding is done in C. However,
the future, for compiled code at least, is Vala and Genie. I have
written a series of web pages that introduce Genie with some tutorials:<br>
      <br>
      <a href="http://puppylinux.com/genie/">
http://puppylinux.com/genie/</a><br>
      <br>
Two of our Puppy developers in particular are heavily into Vala and
Genie coding, Nicolas and MU (Mark). They have written wonderful
applications, remarkable for their simple code and tiny size: NicoEdit,
Pictureviewer, PuppyBrowser for example.<br>

      <h3>Future puppies</h3>
The Woof build system enables us to build Puppy from any distro's
packages. I have released experimental builds of "Upup", Puppy built
from Ubuntu Jaunty packages. What's the point? -- well, you get the tiny size (approx. 100MB
live-CD) and wonderful speed of Puppy, a user interface and user
experience that is totally Puppy, the full suite of applications and
utilities as in any other Puppy, yet built from Ubuntu packages and
able to install further packages from the Ubuntu repositories.<br>
      <br>
Other builds are active. Ttuuxxx and Gposil are working on "Dpup", a Debian-based build [<a href="http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=45552">1</a> <a href="http://www.dpup.org/">2</a>], and Kirk is working on "Tpup", codenamed <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fatdog2</span>, a build from packages compiled in T2 [<a href="http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=45335">1</a> <a href="http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=45322">2</a>].<br>
      <br>
All of these are available for testing. Please look on the forum for latest announcements: <a href="http://murga-linux.com/puppy/">http://murga-linux.com/puppy/</a>.<br>
