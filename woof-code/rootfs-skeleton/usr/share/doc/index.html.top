Hi, I am Barry Kauler, the original developer of the Puppy Operating System, and you can find a complete
introduction to Puppy on the web at: <a href="http://www.puppylinux.com/">http://www.puppylinux.com/</a> and <a href="http://www.puppylinux.org/">http://www.puppylinux.org/</a>.<br>
<br>You are going to be amazed at the quantity and quality of
applications in such a tiny Linux 'distro', as well as blown away by
the speed and stunned by the ease-of-use.<br>
<br>
My aim is for Puppy to become a no-brainer to use (ie, no need to read
the
manual!). Just turn on the PC, and off you go... we're not there yet,
as some
configuration files may have to be edited, plus various apps have to be
"tweaked". Maybe some of your PC hardware doesn't work --
in that case, first browse through the online documentation, then
search the Puppy Discussion Forum -- as a last resort, post a question.<br>
<br>
I would like to very briefly acknowledge all the guys whose programs I have
used in Puppy. Truly, I am standing on the shoulders of many others to reach
this new pinnacle that is the achievement of Puppy Linux. I have acknowledged
people throughout the documentation and on the web, and my profuse gratitude
goes out to all you guys who code just because you love doing it. I would
also like to send out a special thank-you for the help received from the guys
on the Puppy Discussion Forum.<br>
<br>
In fact, if you look at the release notes linked-to above, what is immediately apparent
is that Puppy Linux is now a team effort, a change that has been incrementally increasing so over the last couple of
years. Any acknowledgement now needs to go to our entire "Puppy Team" rather than just me.
