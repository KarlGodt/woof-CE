                <b>QUISP (quick server pages)</b></font> is a simple,
                complete solution for developing database-driven dynamic web
                sites. It includes its own embedded SQL database which stores
                data in ascii text files, and optionally can include an
                embedded data charting package (<a href="http://ploticus.sourceforge.net">ploticus</a>). <br>
                <br>
                QUISP is a template processor that lets you generate HTML on
                the fly.  You create your HTML in a text editor, then add
                directives such as <tt>#include</tt>, <tt>#if</tt>,
                <tt>#for</tt>, <tt>#while</tt>, <tt>#sql</tt>, or
                <tt>#shell</tt>.  When a user accesses your page, QUISP loads
                your page code, evaluates embedded QUISP directives, and
                sends pure HTML out to the user's browser.  Your web site
                will likely have a number of pages, and you can organize them
                into directories if you want. <br>
                <br>


                <h3>What existing problems does QUISP attempt to address?</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Currently available dynamic web platforms (such as
                    MySQL / PHP) are complex and require significant time and
                    expertise (as well as system privileges) to install,
                    administer, and upgrade. For some projects, especially
                    smaller ones or prototypes, this sometimes seems like
                    overkill.</li>
                  <li>Dependency on such large underlying systems can cause
                    delays in getting started, and when these underlying
                    systems are upgraded applications can break.</li>
                  <li>Applications written for MySQL/PHP (etc.) cannot be
                    delivered and deployed on remote systems unless those
                    systems are running compatible versions of MySQL and
                  PHP.</li>
                  <li>Dynamic content systems that are tightly coupled to the
                    web server can be cumbersome to customize or upgrade.
                    <p>QUISP has been developed as a simpler unified model
                    that has no external DBMS or middleware dependencies,
                    requires no root privileges, and can be extended and
                    customized by an average "C" programmer. <br>
                    <br>
                    </p>

                    <h3>What makes QUISP special?</h3>
                  </li>
                  <li>QUISP depends on <b>no</b> other packages (such as a
                    DBMS) at runtime</li>
                  <li>QUISP is a CGI and works with any generic unix- or
                    linux-based web server</li>
                  <li>easy to install.. no root privilege is generally needed
                    to install or deploy applications</li>
                  <li>easy to copy, clone, or move QUISP web sites</li>
                  <li>extensible.. your "C" language functions can be easily
                    incorporated; it's also easy to execute shell programs
                    and capture the results.</li>
                  <li>QUISP's integrated SQL database (shsql)
                    stores data in ordinary ascii text files.. you can edit
                    data with a text editor or easily import into other
                    software</li>
                  <li>nice HTML forms and SQL interface capabilities</li>
                  <li>an optional integrated data graphing engine (<a href="http://ploticus.sourceforge.net">ploticus</a>)</li>
                  <li>"list-centric" features-- small-scale vectorization can
                    be handled by comma-delimited
                    lists</li>
                  <li>nice "web-aware" features such as timeout record
                    locking and comparison operators for intuitive search</li>
                  <li>QUISP uses a syntax that contrasts nicely to HTML or
                    XML, which can help with code readability</li>
                  <li>QUISP reduces project complexity by eliminating the
                    need for full-scale DBMS and middleware <br>
                    <br>


                    <h3>Who should consider QUISP?</h3>
                    Developers of small- or medium- scale systems on
                    unix/linux platforms who: <br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>don't have a platform such as MySQL/PHP solidly
                    available, or choose not to use it</li>
                  <li>wish to deploy or deliver dependency-free dynamic web
                    site solutions</li>
                  <li>want easy access to their own "C" functions or shell
                    commands</li>
                  <li>want an easy way to add dynamic <a href="http://ploticus.sourceforge.net">ploticus
                    graphics</a> into their web pages</li>
                  <li>want to manage data without going through SQL all the
                    time</li>
                  <li>can work within the parameters and limitations of QUISP and SHSQL. <br>
                    <br>


                    <h3>Who should avoid QUISP?</h3>
                  </li>
                  <li>developers whose needs are best met by the
                    functionality, performance, and complexity provided by
                    packages such as MySQL/PHP</li>
                  <li>situations where adherance to existing IT standards is
                    mandatory or where creativity, experimentation, and
                    trying new things are prohibited <br>
                    <br>


                    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
                    You'll need to be on a system with a working web server
                    (but you don't need to have control over that web
                    server).  In addition, you should be comfortable
                  with:</li>
                  <li>creating basic HTML pages on your system using a text
                    editor</li>
                  <li>URLs and the difference between a URL and a file
                    pathname</li>
                  <li>CGI basics, and how to install CGIs that will be
                    accessible to your web server</li>
                  <li>Unix skills such as setting file permissions modes,
                    creating setuid executables, and creating soft links.</li>
