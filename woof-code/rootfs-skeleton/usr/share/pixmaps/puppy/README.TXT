This directory is specifically for SVG format icons unique to Puppy Linux. 
By tradition they are to be kept as small (in file size) as practical.

Let height and width be 100px
- We can scale all icons the by the same factor, and resize 'all' targets here (ie gtkdialog buttons).
  This will be handy for touch screens.
