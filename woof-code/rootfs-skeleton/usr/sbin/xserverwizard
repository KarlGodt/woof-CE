   <text><label>Puppy has a variety of X servers to choose from. The live-CD has the Xvesa Kdrive server and/or the Xorg, and custom builds may also have the Xfbdev or Xi810 Kdrive servers. The Kdrive servers are a simplified and smaller server. If one of these is not in the live-CD, it can be downloaded and installed as a $_PPM_ package.</label></text>
