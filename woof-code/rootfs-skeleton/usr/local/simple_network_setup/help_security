$(gettext "This is more secure than WEP and is the recommended choice if your router and Linux driver supports it. There are actually two types WPA and WPA2, but ticking the 'WPA' radiobutton will use whichever of these is available. Also, there are two encryption management schemes, known as 'TKIP' and 'AES' -- again, whichever is available will be automatically used.")
