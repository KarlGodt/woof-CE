 <text  use-markup=\"true\"><label>\"<b>Dialup analog or wireless modem</b>
Analog dialup is the old slow system. You need a 56K modem and it dials your Internet Service Provider.
Wireless dialup is a digital system, typically via a 3G wireless network. If you have a 3G modem or want to connect to the Internet via your mobile phone, choose this.

<b>Wired or wireless LAN</b>
If you have broadband Internet connection and not sure what button to click, this is probably the right one. Either you have a network cable or wireless card from your computer, to 'something' (usually an ADSL modem or router) that then connects you via a telephone socket in the wall, then this is the right button. Choose this also if you want to connect to an intranet and not necessarily have outside access.

<b>Wireless GPRS modem</b>
GPRS is a wireless Internet technology, running on top of a GSM cellular phone connection. It provides very cheap Internet access throughout Costa Rica, and is popular in several European countries.

<b>Cable/DSL/wireless PPPOE</b>
Many countries have this system (notably not the UK). Some builds of Puppy have two different applications, 'Pppoeconf' and 'Roaring Penguin' -- or one might be a PET package. Use what works for you, give feedback on the forum, as these, particularly Pppoeconf, are a work-in-progress.\"</label></text>
