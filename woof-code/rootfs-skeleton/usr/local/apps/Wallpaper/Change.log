Karl Reimer Godt : March 2013 :
* Toggle when clicking the Clear button, to be able to bring back the PuppyPin
* Try to put common code in common.sau ( .sau for being sourced (sauce))
* Made that work
* Wallpaper slider to support seconds, minutes, hours
* Better support for Spaces in Directory Names or File Names
* slideshow is now not dependent on external scripts/wrappers
