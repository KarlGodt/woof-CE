#v3.98 bugfix by 'urban soul'.

# This is the config file for WAG's profile management.
# It allows you to store the connection information for access points.
# For now you must set it up by hand.
# Two connections are supplied by default.
# The first is called 'autoconnect'.  It clears all settings
# and forces your card to connect to the best station it can find.
# The second is a template.  Copy it when making a new entry.

# WAG uses a combination of context search and line counting to
# find the required information.  Don't misspell a line or delete
# an unneeded line.  This will break the profile.  Settings not
# required should be set to 
# TITLE must be sequentially numbered.
