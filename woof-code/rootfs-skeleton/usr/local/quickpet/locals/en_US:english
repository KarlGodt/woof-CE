export LOC_202="Welcome to Lucid Puppy's Quickpet
	There are three main tabs for Pets, Puppy's package format Pets 
are very straight forward. Once you make your selection and click the icon
the pet package is downloaded from a Puppy repository. This may take some 
time on slow connections so please be patient.Once it has arrived the 
PPM (Puppy Package Manager) opens and asks some simple questions which, as 
long as you select OK, will install your package ready for use. You will see 
a Success message at the top of your screen.
	There is a preferences feature which allows you to select the Puppy 
repository that works best for you. If one doesn't work or is too slow
you can change it to another one.
    A Drivers tab is provided so that you can install an apropriate video
driver for your specific hardware. For Nvidia there are other drivers in the 
Puppy Package Manager in the Main Menu. For Radeon and Intel the Xorg High 
Package is recommended.
	There is also an extra tab called News. This is for News about Lucid Puppy 
with fixes and features.
	If you run into trouble there is a help file in the Support menu.
	Don't forget you can install packages from the main Puppy Package 
Manager from the main Puppy menu. Also Lucid Lynx debs can be installed.
	Enjoy using Lucid Puppy"          ##changed Update for news
export LOC_203="Please note that the following entries are links to 
applications compiled and prepared by Puppy Linux
enthusiasts. No warranty is offerred. Most fall 
under the Gnu GPL licence and it's variants. Most 
of these programs are maintained regularly and 
therefore are not suitable for hosting in a

export LOC_204="If Quickpet is failing for you there's no need to despair.
All packages are in Puppy's Package Manager available from the \"Install\" Desktop Icon.
You can click Quickpet on The Web and a web page will open so that you can download the 
packages from weblinks. There are links to other programs that are reported to work in 
Lucid Puppy in the More Programs tab.
	You can change your download repository in the File menu, Preferences entry to a location closer 
to you or a mirror that works better for you. Your choice is remembered. You can also change 
the default action of deleting pet packages in /root.quickpet/Downloads to saving.
	Downloaded packages are stored within your pupsave/installation. You can see what is there 
by clicking the Download Directory menu and move these packages if you wish. You can also clear 
your Download Directory with the Clear Downloaded Packages menu entry. This is only if you save packages.
	There is also a menu for SFS files. These are special packages usually made from quite large 
programs which can be installed with out using space in your pupsave. For more information click 
the SFS Support menu entry.
Enjoy using Lucid Puppy!
