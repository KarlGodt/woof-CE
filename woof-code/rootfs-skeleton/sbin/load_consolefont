# A console font gets loaded in the initrd, or failing that in rc.country.
# I was also loading it in /usr/sbin/quicksetup is locale is changed.
# However, we have problems with it getting "dropped", which seems to happen when run X.
# So, i have created this script that will call whenever we exit from X, such as
# in xwin and in xorgwizard. thanks to L18L for investigating this.
