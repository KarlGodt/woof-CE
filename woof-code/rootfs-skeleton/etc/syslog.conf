#       The  priority  is  one  of  the following keywords, in ascending order:
#       debug, info, notice, warning, warn (same as warning), err, error  (same
#       as err), crit, alert, emerg, panic (same as emerg).  The keywords warn,
#       error and panic are deprecated and should not  be  used  anymore.   The
#       priority defines the severity of the message


#       Here are some examples, partially taken from a real existing  site  and
#       configuration.   Hopefully  they answer all questions about configuring
#       syslogd(8), if not, drop me (Joey) a line.

              # Store critical stuff in critical
              #
              *.=crit;kern.none            /var/adm/critical

#       This  will  store  all  messages  of  priority   crit   in   the   file
#       /var/adm/critical, with the exception of any kernel messages.

              # Kernel messages are stored in the kernel file,
              # critical messages and higher ones also go
              # to another host and to the console
              #
              kern.*                       /var/adm/kernel
              kern.emerg                   /var/adm/kernel-emerg
              kern.alert                   /var/adm/kernel-alert
              kern.crit                    /var/adm/kernel-crit@finlandia
              kern.crit                    /dev/console
              kern.error                   /var/adm/kernel-error
              kern.warn                    /var/adm/kernel-warn
              kern.notice                  /var/adm/kernel-notice
              kern.info;kern.!err          /var/adm/kernel‐info
              kern.debug                   /var/adm/kernel-debug


#       The  first rule directs any message that has the kernel facility to the
#       file /var/adm/kernel.  (But recall that only the kernel itself can  log
#       to this facility.)

#       The  second  statement directs all kernel messages of priority crit and
#       higher to the remote host finlandia.  This is useful,  because  if  the
#       host crashes and the disks get irreparable errors you might not be able
#       to read the stored messages.  If they’re on a  remote  host,  too,  you
#       still can try to find out the reason for the crash.

#       The  third  rule directs kernel messages of priority crit and higher to
#       the actual console, so the person who works on  the  machine  will  get
#       them, too.

#       The fourth line tells the syslogd to save all kernel messages that come
#       with priorities from info up to warning in  the  file  /var/adm/kernel‐
#       info.


#       This  is  an  example of the 2nd selector overwriting part of the first
#       one.  The first selector selects kernel messages of priority  info  and
#       higher.   The  second  selector filters out kernel messages of priority
#       error and higher.  This leaves just priorities info, notice and warning
#       to get logged.

              # The tcp wrapper logs with mail.info, we display
              # all the connections on tty12
              #
              mail.=info                   /dev/tty12

#       This  directs  all  messages  that  use mail.info (in source LOG_MAIL |
#       LOG_INFO) to /dev/tty12, the 12th console.  For example the  tcpwrapper
#       tcpd(8) uses this as its default.

              # Write all mail related logs to a file
              #
              mail.*;mail.!=info           /var/adm/mail


#       This  pattern  matches  all  messages that come with the mail facility,
#       except for the info  priority.   These  will  be  stored  in  the  file
#       /var/adm/mail.

              # Log all mail.info and news.info messages to info
              #
              mail,news.=info              /var/adm/info

#       This  will extract all messages that come either with mail.info or with
#       news.info and store them in the file /var/adm/info.

              # Log info and notice messages to messages file
              #
              *.=info;mail.none          /var/log/messages
              *.=notice;mail.none        /var/log/messages
#                   mail.none  /var/log/messages

#       This lets the syslogd log all messages that come with either  the  info
#       or  the notice priority into the file /var/log/messages, except for all
#       messages that use the mail facility.


              # Log info messages to messages file
              #
              *.=info;mail.none                  /var/log/messages
              *.=info;news.none                  /var/log/messages
#                   mail,news.none       /var/log/messages

#       This statement causes the syslogd to log all messages  that  come  with
#       the  info priority to the file /var/log/messages.  But any message com‐
#       ing either with the mail or the news facility will not be stored.

              # Emergency messages will be displayed using wall
              #
              *.=emerg                     *

#       This rule tells the syslogd to write all emergency messages to all cur‐
#       rently logged in users.  This is the wall action.

              # Messages of the priority alert will be directed
              # to the operator
              #
              *.alert                      root,joey


#       This  rule directs all messages of priority alert or higher to the ter‐
#       minals of the operator, i.e. of the  users  ‘‘root’’  and  ‘‘joey’’  if
#       they’re logged in.

              *.*                          /var/log/messages@finlandia

#       This  rule  would redirect all messages to a remote host called finlan‐
#       dia.  This is useful especially in a cluster of machines where all sys‐
#       log messages will be stored on only one machine.

#CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX DIFFERENCES
#       Syslogd  uses  a  slightly  different syntax for its configuration file
#       than the original BSD sources.  Originally all messages of  a  specific
#       priority  and  above  were  forwarded  to  the log file.  The modifiers
#       ‘‘=’’, ‘‘!’’  and ‘‘‐’’ were added to make the  syslogd  more  flexible
#       and to use it in a more intuitive manner.

#       The  original  BSD  syslogd  doesn’t  understand  spaces  as separators
#       between the selector and the action field.
