.crossfire directory :
Contains files related to the game crossfire.
See
    crossfire.real-time.com
and
    metalforege.net
for details .

Private directory that hasn't anything to do with Puppy Linux .
Mainly here for the clientside-scripting directories s and s2 .

The file keys contains keybindings, that I am too tired to setup new each time .
