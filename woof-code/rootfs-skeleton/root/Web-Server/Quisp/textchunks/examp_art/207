Lomax, John Arthur ROI RBA (1857 - 1923)
 John Arthur Lomax was a Manchester born genre painter. He studied painting in 
Stuttgart and the Munich Academy but returned to Manchester and later relocated 
to London. His subjects were mostly historical of the 17th and 18th Century, 
especially of the civil war period, and often with a dramatic or sentimental 
theme. Lomax was a regular exhibitor at Suffolk Street and also at the Royal 
Academy from 1880.
