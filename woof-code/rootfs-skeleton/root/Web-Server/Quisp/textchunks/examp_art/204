An exquisitely detailed marine watercolor painting on canvas of the SS Repton 
(an American admiral). It is signed (and possibly dated) on the lower left, but 
the signature is indecipherable. Unusual in a watercolor, the colors are very 
intense with no fading. It is in almost perfect condition (one small repair on 
reverse of the canvas) behind glass in its magnificent gilded and wood wide 
concave frame.
