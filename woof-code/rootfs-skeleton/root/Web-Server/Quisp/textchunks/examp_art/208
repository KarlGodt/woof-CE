The painting represents a well-fed clergy man in his chair smoking an after 
dinner cigar. There is a humorous twist to this fine painting and the happy 
face of the man is very skillfully painted. The work is painted in a vintage 
style, though with visible brushstrokes and shows high quality. A very 
attractive work in a beautiful period frame. Artist:  Signed "N. Grützner". 
Unidentified likely Austrian artist. Possibly connected to the well-known 
artist Eduard von Grützner known for burlesque scenes with clergymen. A painting 
by E.Grützner was sold at Carola van Ham in Cologne on 30 October 1999 for 
1,681.
